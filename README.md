# Weather-APP

I created this weather application using UnsplashAPI,
OpenWeather API and Node to provide weather of any city
around the globe. The search option makes it easy for users to
find weather information for their specific location. This
application is a reliable source of weather information for users.
The application provides the current temperature, humidity,
windspeed, etc
